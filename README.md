# zy.css

Kieran's minimal and almost classless CSS

## Goals

* Use 16 colours <https://johndecember.com/html/spec/color16.html>
* Have a non-web developer (me) understand every line of it

## Deploy

Navigate to the folder you want the static folder to be placed in.

```bash
curl -LsS https://github.com/kism/zy.css/releases/download/main/grab.sh | bash
```
