Kieran's Minimal and almost Classless CSS

## Goals

* Use 16 colours
* Have a non-web developer (me) understand every line of it

## Deploy

Navigate to the folder you want the static folder to be placed in.

```bash
curl -LsS https://github.com/kism/zy.css/releases/download/main/grab.sh | bash
```
